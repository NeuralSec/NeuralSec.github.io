I received my Bachelor’s degree in Optoelectronics Informatics from Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), China. I then switched to studying computer science/information security and obtained my doctoral degree in Australia jointly with CSIRO's Data61. I subsequently continued my research career in CSIRO’s Data61 as a CERC postdoctoral fellow in 2020, where I am now a research scientist working on machine learning security and privacy.

My primary research interest resides in the joint distribution of adversarial robustness, neural backdoors, robustness/privacy verification, and real-world security & privacy issues of machine learning systems. I publish in top journals and conferences, such as IEEE TDSC, TIFS, ICDCS, SP, NDSS, NeurIPS, ICML, and ACSAC. I also serve as a program committee member and a (sub)reviewer for international conferences/journals like WWW, ACML, NDSS, IEEE SP, Usenix Security, IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS, and IEEE TIP. I have been honoured with awards such as the Distinguished Paper Award at the NDSS Symposium. I have been playing drums in my spare time since 2013. Table tennis is my favourite weekly sport.

# **My Research Focuses**
Certified robustness/data learnability at scale:
- Certified learnability for data learnability control (*NDSS’25*)
- Certified robustness of DRL agents (*USENIX Sec’25*)
- Curse of dimensionality in certified robustness (*ICML’24*)

Data privacy and learnability control:
- Perturbative availability poisons (*NDSS’25, USENIX Sec’25*)
- Other perturbative protections and unlearning (*NDSS’25, USENIX Sec’25, ...*)

Red teaming and defensive solutions for ML systems:
- Red teaming and robustness evaluation (*SP’23, AAAI’24, ...*)
- Defenses against backdoors and adversarial attacks (*NDSS’23, NeurIPS’23, ACSAC’19, ...*)

My ultimate goal is to make AI truly trustworthy through *provable guarantees*, *causality*, and *human alignment*.
For prospective students and researchers interested in collaboration: Please feel free to shoot me an email if these align with your research interests.
