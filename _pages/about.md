I received my Bachelor’s degree in Optoelectronics Informatics from Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), China. I then switched to studying computer science/information security and obtained my doctoral degree in Australia jointly with CSIRO's Data61. I subsequently continued my research career in CSIRO’s Data61 as a CERC postdoctoral fellow in 2020, where I am now a research scientist working on machine learning security and privacy.

My primary research interest resides in the joint distribution of adversarial robustness, neural backdoors, robustness verification, and real-world security & privacy issues of machine learning systems. I publish in top journals and conferences, such as IEEE TDSC, TIFS, ICDCS, SP, NDSS, NeurIPS, and ACSAC. I also serve as a program committee member and a (sub)reviewer for international conferences/journals like WWW, ACML, NDSS, IEEE SP, Usenix Security, IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS, and IEEE TIP. I have been playing drums in my spare time since 2013. Table tennis is my favourite weekly sport.
