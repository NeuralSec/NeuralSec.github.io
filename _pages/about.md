I received my Bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), China. I worked towards my doctoral degree in Swinburne University and CSIRO's Data61, Australia. I am currently a CERC postdoctoral fellow with CSIRO's Data61. I am working under Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platform.

My primary research interest resides in adversarial machine learning and AI-related cybersecurity. My other research interests include deep neural networks, applied machine learning, decision-making systems, and complex networks. I have been playing drums in my spare time since 2013. Table tennis is my favourite weekly sports.
