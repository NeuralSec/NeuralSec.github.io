I received my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), China and my doctoral degree in Australia. I am currently a CERC postdoctoral fellow with CSIRO's Data61. I am working under Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platform.

My primary research interest resides in the joint distribution of adversarial robustness verification, neural backdoors, and real-world security & privacy issues of machine learning systems. I have been playing drums in my spare time since 2013. Table tennis is my favourite weekly sport.
