I received my Bachelor’s degree in Optoelectronics Information from Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), China. I then switched to studying computer science/information security and obtained my doctoral degree in Australia. I joined CSIRO’s Data61 as a CERC postdoctoral fellow in 2020, where I am now a research scientist working on machine learning security and privacy.

My primary research interest resides in the joint distribution of adversarial robustness verification, neural backdoors, and real-world security & privacy issues of machine learning systems. I have been playing drums in my spare time since 2013. Table tennis is my favourite weekly sport.
